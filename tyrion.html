        <p>Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Tyrion is a dwarf and member of House Lannister, one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional kingdom of Westeros. He subsequently appeared in Martin's A Clash of Kings (1998) and A Storm of Swords (2000). Tyrion was one of a few prominent characters that were not included in 2005's A Feast for Crows, but returned in the next novel A Dance with Dragons (2011). The character will also appear in the forthcoming volume The Winds of Winter.[6][7] The popularity of the character led Martin and Bantam Books to publish The Wit and Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister, an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels, in 2013. In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the impact of the marginalization and derision he has received all of his life — even from his own family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. But as the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to come apart, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is tasked by his father to impose order on the capital of King's Landing—as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king—as civil war is sparked. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey — including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost, and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger, but without his Lannister resources.</p>

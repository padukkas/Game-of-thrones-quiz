        <p>Cersei is born as the only daughter and first child of Tywin Lannister and his wife Joanna, with her twin brother Jaime born soon after. Cersei and Jaime begin an incestuous affair early in their childhood, which was discovered by their mother but kept this a secret. After her mother died giving birth to their dwarf brother Tyrion, Cersei blamed Tyrion. Because of her beauty and high birth, she was floated as a high-value marriage prospect for a variety of suitors, having absolutely no say in the decision. After a long and convoluted process, she came to be wed to King Robert Baratheon; a man who never loved her and repeatedly cheated on her. These events left behind a memory of bitterness and hatred that persisted through her adult life. She resumes her affair with her brother, birthing Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen by Jaime. During her teenage years, she hears a prophecy that all of her closest childhood friends will soon die, her children will die during her lifetime, and that she will be thrown out by a younger and more beautiful queen than she. When her friend dies shortly thereafter, she treats this as a confirmation of the truth of the revelation and spends her entire adult life attempting to subvert the prophecy, and eventually develops a strong paranoia over this.</p>
